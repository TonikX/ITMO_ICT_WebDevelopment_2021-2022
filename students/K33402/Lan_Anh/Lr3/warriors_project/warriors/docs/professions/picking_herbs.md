**Herbalism** allows you to find and harvest herbs from particular resource nodes scattered around the world using [Herb Gathering]. It is a primary profession. While a very small number of herbs are sometimes used for other trade skills, the vast majority are used for Alchemy and Inscription. Starting with the TBC Burning Crusade expansion, mobs will appear in-game that can be harvested.

See harvestable mobs for a list.
